# Spark Recruitment Challenge

**Data input**
- ./data/googleplaystore.csv
- ./data/googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv

**Exercise 2**

Output: ./data/out/best_apps/

**Exercise 4**

Output: ./data/out/googleplaystore_cleaned/

**Exercise 5**

Output: ./data/out/googleplaystore_metrics/

**Note:**
For this exercise df4 (output of exercise 4) was used instead of df3 (output of exercise 3). Df3 does not contain information about the sentiment polarity.
Therefore df4 was used instead. I'm aware that, for this exercise, the output "Average_Sentiment_Polarity" is an "average of averages", where each app has equal weight instead of each user review.
